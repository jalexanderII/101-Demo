GOAL: WRITE DOC PER THE BELOW. DO NOT WRITE CODE/IMPLEMENT

TASK:
See the feature request below. Create a concise implementation checklist, and structure it so that multiple eng can work on different parts in parrallel. First step should be to define the types so that both backend and frontend eng have the same contract. Your checklist should be lightweight, say 'what' needs to be done, not 'how' to do it. leave the actual implementation details to the enginner who will have more context/experience. 


Save the checklist as a new markdown locally in docs/
