# GOAL

WRITE DOC PER THE BELOW. DO NOT WRITE CODE. DO NOT START IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS A DOC WRITING STEP ONLY.

## TASK

See the feature request below. Create a concise implementation checklist, and structure it so that multiple eng can work on different parts in parallel. First step should be to define the types so that both backend and frontend eng have the same contract. Your checklist should be lightweight, say 'what' needs to be done, not 'how' to do it. leave the actual implementation details to the engineer who will have more context/experience.
