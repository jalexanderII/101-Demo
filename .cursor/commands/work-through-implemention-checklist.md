# GOAL

Read the checklist each time, since multiple engineers are working on the file and so it will be updated regularly.

Read your todo tasks, then as you implement each item, periodically update the checklist to mark what is done.

As you work, if you discover new tasks, or learnings, update the checklist accordingly so we have a full linage of everything that was actually completed.  

You are only done when you have marked off all the items on the section of the implementation checklist which you were assigned.
